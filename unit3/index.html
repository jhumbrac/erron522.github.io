	<section id="about">
		<p>Here at Hope Construction we build more than structures. We believe that every commercial property, educational facility, health care site or housing development must meet the unique needs of those who live, work or play there. Just as our clients serve different sectors of the public, so we pride ourselves on serving you.</p>
		<p>From the outset, we spend time learning about your organization. We ask what has worked—or not worked—in the past and what you envision for the future. We invite you to share with us your mission and any assessment tools that indicate how we might create a better experience out of the construction of your facility. We want to know what would boost employee satisfaction and how you can better serve your customers, whether they are professionals, consumers, students, patients or residents. Having assessed your specific goals, we then provide creative options that fall within your budget and time frame. We are not merely interested in how your building will function, but also in the experience people will have within that building.</p>
		<p>We explain each phase of the project, helping you make informed decisions that work for you and your clients. Then, once construction is underway, we keep you informed at every stage, responding to any concerns that surface. Brick by brick, we build relationships with our clients. Your satisfaction is the motor which holds our working relationship together.</p>
